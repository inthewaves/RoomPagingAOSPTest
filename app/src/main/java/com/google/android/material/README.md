This is taken from
[material-components-android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android)
version 1.4.0-beta01, because 1.3.0 introduced (circular) progress indicators, while the version of
material-components-android in AOSP is stuck at 1.1.0-alpha05. 1.4.0-alpha01 contains various fixes
for `ProgressIndicator`.

`androidx.dynamicanimation:dynamicanimation:1.0.0` is required.
